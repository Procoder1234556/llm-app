Objective of this Assignment
The goal of this assignment is to assess your ability to build a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application if hired by a startup or an MNC. Your application will connect to a data source (static or real-time) to solve a real-world problem using RAG techniques. This assignment will test your understanding of RAG concepts, your ability to integrate data sources, and your skill in applying machine learning and natural language processing to generate insightful, contextually relevant responses.

AI/ML Intern, Data Science Intern, NLP Intern, AI Product Management (Intern), Software Development Intern (AI/ML focus)

Problem Statements
Select from the following problem statements or propose an innovative RAG application under the Open Innovation category:
UPSC Current Affairs Interpreter
Objective: Create a tool for civil services aspirants, interpreting recent events and connecting them with historical context using news API data.
Example Output: An application providing briefs on current events, highlighting multiple perspectives and their historical significance, specifically designed for UPSC preparation.
College Rule Interpreter
Objective: Develop a RAG application that deciphers PDFs (e.g., timetables, rulebooks, curriculum books) to assist students and administrators with queries about daily operations, including contacts and verification links.
Example Output: A query tool where a student inputs "How do I apply for scholarships?" and receives a generated response: "Students can apply for scholarships through the university portal [link]. For eligibility and documents required, refer to page 5 of the Scholarship Rules PDF [link]. Contact the financial aid office at [contact information] for further assistance."
User Intelligence Assistant
Objective: Design an AI to analyze competitor GitHub repositories or GitHub issues, or product reviews, pinpointing frequent criticisms or problem areas.
Example Output: A report generator that scans GitHub issues page or product review sites, producing insights on common issues with specific products.
Open Innovation
Objective: Propose and develop any RAG application that demonstrates innovative use of retrieval-augmented generation to solve a unique problem.
Example Output: Your creative solution addressing a specific need or opportunity, leveraging RAG technology for impactful outcomes.
